Ok, what's the concept?

I want a ring of lights around the edge of my table that can indicate who's turn it is.

When someone sits down at the table there will be a single button below the edge of the table that they can press.
Would it be cooler if the button was visible?

There are two phases, set up and usage.

Will I need a seperate button to initiate setup?

What if instead any button can initiate setup by being held for a long time?

So, one person holds the button and the system resets.

Then each person can press their own buttons and the system will add them to the included seats.

How do we end the setup phase?

Maybe it's another long press to get out?

Then, the system will pick a start player (randomly?) and each time the current player presses their button the light will travel around the table to the next registered seat.

I'll need an on/off switch of some sort. 

How complicated can I make the click patterns?
